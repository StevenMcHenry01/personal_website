title: "My First Blog Post, and Why It's So Scary"

## Writing your first blog post is a daunting concept. In a world of multi-year running blogs and incredible content creators, how do you even take that first step?

When sitting down to write my first blog post there were a few things going through my head.
>*"Will anyone even read this?"*

>*"Do you just jump into a technical topic?"*

>*"Who are **YOU** to be writing about anything with authority?"*

All of these thoughts are indeed valid, and ones that probably go through most virgin-bloggers' heads
when they sit down for their first mind-dump. In the end I thought a blog post about writing your
first blog post was as good a place as any to start, even if a bit too meta for my liking.

## On people reading your writing

I think that asking yourself why you are writing something is an important first step. If you are
writing in order to generate buzz around a specific topic or maybe to boost your industry clout, then it is likely the writing will not contain a soul. Contrary to where you think this is going, I actually think that is totally fine. Not every piece of writing has to be some internal exposÃ© and there is no shame in promotion. In fact, there is almost always a hint of promotion lurking in everything that we do.

Inevitably when someone does end up reading one of your pieces, even if it's just your
significant other (*fun fact: your loved ones will forever be biased and gentle in their criticism no matter how much you ask them not to be*), you have to be ready for them to
either skim through it halfheartedly or dislike in entirely. This feels like a personal attack, but it is really just a result of an endless stream of **better** content in the world. In this instance, there is simply too much amazing talent out there for someone to care about your ramblings.

## On writing from a place of authority

In the end there will always be someone who is better and more informed than you are
on a given subject. This is of course true until you get to the top of the ladder and
that person still probably believes they are inadequate. This should not stop you from writing
about said topic, but it should keep you from making definitive statements with no wiggle room. After-all:
>*"Only a sith deals in absolutes"*.

There will almost always be more to learn, and you certainly do not want to be the person
who dies on the hill with wilting grass.

None of this is to say that you should only write about things that you have done your
absolute due diligence on. At times it can make sense to write about topics that you are
just starting out on and be a place of sanctuary for others pursuing the same endeavor.
Your readers can come along for the ride of your learning and perhaps even laugh at your
shortcomings that you have so graciously displayed to the world. In the end, even if someone
is finding joy in your fumbling, you are still bringing the world more delight aren't you?

## When in doubt

Finally, I wish to leave you with a story.

When I first entered the post-highschool world, I was bright eyed, bushy tailed, and ready to tackle anything. I strut into my
introductory programming class with a smile plastered on my naive face. I had always wanted to be a programmer and this was the beginning of my four-year, successful journey. After the first two weeks of class, the
instructor said something along the lines of:
>"If you don't understand the concept of different types of variables by this point, I am afraid you may not be cut out for this major."

It just so happens that I indeed did **not** understand the concept of different forms of variables at that point and immediately dropped out of the entire program and moved to LA. This would end
up being one of my most regretted decisions and still haunts me to this day. I let this person tell me what I was or was not capable of. The only person who can honestly say that
about yourself is **you**; and yes you are capable of making this determination as hard as it is at times.

I had doubt then, and I still have doubt while writing my first blog post. The only thing we
can do is push past this feeling and make things happen. So go out there and do what scares you. For me, it was writing my first blog post.
